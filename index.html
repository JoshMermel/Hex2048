<p>
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to www.gametutorial.net who provided me with the
bones of this project.  Without them my lack of android experience would have
left me with a much worse product.  I also thank my friends who tested my app
and gave me valuable feedback

<p>
This app was written and tested primarily on the android virtual device emulator
which was a sluggish experience.  Many decisions were made poorly as a result
such as animation time and swipe angle tolerance. After user testing I settled
on a tolerance of 25 degrees for all diagonal angles and 30 degrees for
horizontal swipes because it is ergonomically harder to swipe perfectly
sideways.  I settled on a 1/10 of a second animation and 30fps though one
tester complained that it was too fast.
</p>

<p>
The android SDK was sometimes a joy to use and sometimes are horrible pain.  I
struggled to understand the meaning of views, contexts, activities and other
important objects.  Tools seemed powerful but not discoverable.  Certain things
that seemed like they ought to be easy gave me huge trouble.  I spent nearly
and hour trying fumbling with passing arguments between various project layers
and had to build my own animation framework to move tiles around the board, for
example.
</p>

<p>
Using eclipse rather than my usual choice of code editor, Vim, was also a chore
for me.  Some tools were nice such as suggestions for member variables and
methods after typing Class. were nice, but navigation and space usage felt very
alien to me.  I have gained an appreciation for why one would use and IDE like
eclipse but currently feel more comfortable and productive in Vim.
