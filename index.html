<p>
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to www.gametutorial.net who provided me with the
bones of this project.  Without them my lack of android experience would have
left me with a much worse product.  I also thank my friends who tested my app
and gave me valuable feedback

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>
This app was written and tested entirely on the android virtual device emulator
which was a horrible experience.  Many decisions were made poorly as a result
such as animation time and swipe angle tolerance. After some testing I settled
on a tolerance of 25 degrees for all diagonal angles and 30 degrees for
horizontal swipes because it is ergonomically harder to swipe perfectly
sideways.  I settled on a 1/10 of a second animation and 30fps though one
tester complained that it was too fast.
</p>

<p>
The android SDK was sometimes a joy to use and sometimes are horrible pain.  I
struggled to understand the meaning of views, contexts, activities and other
important objects.  Certain things that seemed like they ought to be easy gave
me huge trouble.  I spent nearly and hour trying fumbling with passing
arguments between various project layers.
</p>

<p>
Using eclipse rather than my usual choice of code editor, Vim, was also a chore
for me.  Some tools were nice such as suggestions for member variables and
methods after typing Class. but navigation and space usage felt very alien to
me.  I have gained an appreciation for why one would use and IDE like eclipse
but currently feel more comfortable and productive in Vim.
